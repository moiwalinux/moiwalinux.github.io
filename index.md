## What's this?

Moiwa Linux is a distribution for desktop based on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/).

## Why based on Alpine?

* Powerful package resources
* Simple and minimal system(based on musl libc and busybox)
* systemd-Free(it uses OpenRC for service manager)
* ...and just for my hobby;)
